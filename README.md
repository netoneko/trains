# Trains

Trains are cool

## Premise

### Building blocks

* `train`
* `route` (has `stations`)
* `station` (has `platforms`)
* `events`

#### Route

Route is a list of stations

#### Train

A train should have a:
* route
* a list of events that happened to it (which should allow us to deduce its status)

#### Station

FIXME not implemented

#### Platform

FIXME not implemented
